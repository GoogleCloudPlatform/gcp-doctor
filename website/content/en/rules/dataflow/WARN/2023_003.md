  Dataflow worker logs are Throttled
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Worker log messages are limited to 15,000 messages every 30 seconds, per worker. If
this limit is reached, a single worker log message is added saying that logging is throttled.

### Remediation

1. Limit the log messages by logging only errors using try/catch blocks within ParDo's.
2. Write the required logs as Strings, make it a second output PCollection that can be written
to a storage sink like BigQuery, Cloud Storage.
