gce/ssh: Analyzes typical factors that might impede SSH connectivity

  Investigates the following for a single windows or linux VM:

  - VM Instance Status: Inspects the VM's lifecycle, CPU, memory, and disk status.
  - User Permissions: Verifies Google Cloud IAM permissions necessary for utilizing
    OS login and metadata-based SSH keys.
  - VM Configuration: Verifies the presence or absence of required metadata.
  - GCE Network connectivity tests: Inspects firewall rules to ensure user can reach the VM.
  - Internal GuestOS checks: Checks for signs of internal Guest OS issues.

     The VM is experiencing high CPU utilization, potentially causing sluggish connection
     Consider upgrading the CPU specifications for the VM instance and then restart it.
     For guidance on stopping a VM, refer to the documentation:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance.
     For more in-depth investigation, connect via the Serial Console to identify
     the problematic process:

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking metadata.

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     SSH metadata is not enabled for the windows instance
     [REMEDIATION]
     Enable SSH on Windows. Follow this guide:

[MANUAL STEP]: Manually check ssh reqired Agents are running on the VM
      Check google-compute-engine-ssh is installed.

   -                                                                      [SKIP]
     [REASON]
     Human Tasks was skipped as runbook is running autonomous mode

[COMPOSITE STEP]: Checking overall GCP permissions required for provided parameters
    Note: Only roles granted at the project level are checked. Permissions inherited from
    ancestor resources such as folder(s) or organization and groups are not checked.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: User has permission to View Cloud Console

   - projects/gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook                               [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     To use the Google Cloud console to access Compute Engine, e.g. SSH in browser,
     principal must have the compute.projects.get permission.
     [REMEDIATION]
     Refer to the documentation:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam#console_permission

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking permissions required to fetch an instance
    Note: Only roles granted at the project level are checked. Permissions inherited from
    ancestor resources such as folder(s) or organization and groups are not checked.

   - projects/gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook                               [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The authenticated user lacks the required permissions for managing instances.
     Required permissions: compute.instances.get, compute.instances.use.
     [REMEDIATION]
     Grant principal none:cannot@example.com a role with the following permissions:
      - compute.instances.get, compute.instances.use
     For instructions, refer to the documentation on connecting with instance admin roles:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam#connectinginstanceadmin

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking permissions required for update SSH metadata in a project or instance
    Note: Only roles granted at the project level are checked. Permissions inherited from
    ancestor resources such as folder(s) or organization and groups are not checked.

   - projects/gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook                               [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The authenticated user lacks the necessary permissions for managing metadata.
     Required permissions: compute.instances.setMetadata or compute.projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata.
     [REMEDIATION]
     To resolve this issue, ensure the user has the following metadata permissions:
      - Add SSH Key to project-level metadata: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/add-ssh-keys#expandable-2
      - Add SSH Key to instance-level metadata: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/add-ssh-keys#expandable-3

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking OS Login Feature is enabled on VM

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     OS login is enabled on the VM, for a metadata-based SSH Key approach
     Note: Metadata-based SSH key authentication will not work on the VM.
     [REMEDIATION]
     When you set OS Login metadata, Compute Engine deletes the VM's authorized_keys
     file and no longer accepts connections using SSH keys stored in project/instance
     metadata. You must choosing between OS login or metadata based SSH key approach.
     If you wish to use metadata ssh keys set the metadata `enable-oslogin=False`

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if the Local User provided has a valid SSH key
    Note: Only roles granted at the project level are checked. Permissions inherited from
    ancestor resources such as folder(s) or organization and groups are not checked.

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Local user "no_user" does not have at least one valid SSH key for the VM. faulty-windows-ssh
     [REMEDIATION]
     To resolve this issue, add a valid SSH key for the user "no_user" by following the instructions:
