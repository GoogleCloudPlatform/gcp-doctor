**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

For any GCS subscriptions to deliver messages successfully, they should
have the appropriate permissions at the project or bucket level.

### Remediation

Assign the [`roles/storage.admin`](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-cloudstorage-subscription#assign_roles_cloudstorage)
role to the Pub/Sub Service Account to assign GCS Storage Admin Permissions.
Alternatively, assign the Pub/Sub Service Account `roles/storage.objectCreator`
and roles/storage.legacyBucketReader roles.

### Further information

The full list of permissions available in these roles can be found at the
[GCS Permissions Doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles).
