  BigQuery query job do not encounter query is too complex
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

A BigQuery query has too many subqueries or query is too complex

```
resource.type="bigquery_resource"
severity=ERROR
protoPayload.methodName="jobservice.jobcompleted"
protoPayload.status.message:"Resources exceeded during query execution: Not enough resources for query planning - too many subqueries or query is too complex"
```

### Remediation

This error occurs when a query is too complex. The primary causes of complexity are:

* WITH clauses that are deeply nested or used repeatedly.
* Views that are deeply nested or used repeatedly.
* Repeated use of the [UNION ALL operator](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#union_example).


To address this error, try the following options:

* Split the query into multiple queries, then use procedural language to run those queries in a sequence with shared state.
* Use temporary tables instead of WITH clauses.
* Rewrite your query to reduce the number of referenced objects and comparisons.
