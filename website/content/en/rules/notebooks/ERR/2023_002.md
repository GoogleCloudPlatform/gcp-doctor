**Product**: [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench)\

### Description

Creating notebook inside VPC requires user and service-*@gcp-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com
to have compute.subnetworks.use and compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp permissions in VPC project

### Remediation

1. Add [“AI Platform Notebooks Service Agent” Role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles?&_ga=2.228497117.-137841820.1685712188#notebooks.serviceAgent) to the Google-provided service account in the format of "service-%number%@gcp-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com" in the project which hosts the notebooks

2. Add [“Compute Network User” Role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles?&_ga=2.228497117.-137841820.1685712188#compute.networkUser) to the account or Google-provided service account in the format of "service-%number%@gcp-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com" in the project which hosts the VPC

3. It is also possible to only add compute.subnetworks.use and compute.subnetworks.useExternalIp permissions to the Google-provided service account in the format of "service-%number%@gcp-sa-notebooks.iam.gserviceaccount.com" in the project which hosts the VPC
