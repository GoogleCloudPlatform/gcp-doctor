  Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebook instances are up to date

**Product**: [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

You might want to upgrade the environment of your user-managed notebooks instance for any of the following reasons:

- To use new capabilities that are only available in a newer version of your environment.

- To benefit from framework updates, package updates, and bug fixes that have been implemented in a newer version of your environment.

### Remediation

There are two ways to upgrade a user-managed notebooks instance:

- **Automatic upgrade**: Enable auto upgrade when you create a user-managed notebooks instance. During a recurring time period that you specify, Vertex AI Workbench checks whether your instance can be upgraded, and if so, Vertex AI Workbench upgrades your instance.

- **Manual upgrade**: If an existing user-managed notebooks instance meets the requirements for upgrading, you can upgrade the instance manually.
