**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

A BigQuery subscription could be configured to forward undeliverable/failed
messages to a special dead-letter topic for further analysis/handling.

### Remediation

When a Pub/Sub message cannot be written to BigQuery, the message cannot be
acknowledged. To forward such undeliverable messages,
[configure a dead-letter topic](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/handling-failures#dead_letter_topic)
on the [BigQuery subscription](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/bigquery#handle_message_failures).
