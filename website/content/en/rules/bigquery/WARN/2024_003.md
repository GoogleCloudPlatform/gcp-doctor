  BigQuery job does not fail due to Maximum API requests per user per method exceeded.
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

BigQuery returns Quota exceeded or Exceeded rate limits error when you hit the
rate limit for the number of API requests to a BigQuery API per user per method.

### Remediation

The quota for a few calls for example, the ```tables.get``` method calls from a service account, or the ```jobs.insert``` method calls. The default quota considered for these calls is 100 calls per second and is enforced per user and not per project.
The error thrown when this limit is breached is as follows:
```Exceeded rate limits: too many api requests per user per method for this user_method```
When you encounter this error, [diagnose](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/troubleshoot-quotas#ts-maximum-api-request-limit-diagnose) the issue and then follow the [recommended](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/troubleshoot-quotas#ts-maximum-api-request-limit-resolution) steps to resolve it.
