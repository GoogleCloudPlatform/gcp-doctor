  Cloud Composer database CPU usage does not exceed 80%
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Airflow database performance issues can lead to overall DAG execution issues. If the database CPU usage exceeds 80% for more than a few percent of the total time, the database is overloaded and requires scaling.

### Remediation

Database size settings are controlled by the environment size property of your environment. To scale the database up or down, [change the environment size](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#env-size) to a different tier (Small, Medium, or Large). Increasing the environment size increases the costs of your environment.
