     [REASON]
     Memory utilization on this VM has reached levels that may compromise its VM application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Elevated memory usage can result in slow or unresponsive or termimated applications.
     Consider enhancing the VM's memory capacity by changing to a machine type with more memory.
     Guidance on stopping and changing the machine type can be found here:
     - Changing machine type: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud
     For deeper analysis of memory issues:

     Additionally, use the Compute Engine observability metrics for an in-depth analysis to pinpoint high-usage processes:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#memory_utilization

     Or connect via the Serial Console if SSH is not available to mitigate the issue.

     [REASON]
     We did not find any Memory related errors in Serial console logs

     [REMEDIATION]
     You may check if VM is facing high memory utilisation from GuestOS side using `free -m`
     or `cat /proc/meminfo` commands.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if VM's Boot disk space utilization is within optimal levels.

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Disk utilization on this VM's boot disk is critically high,
     potentially affecting application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     To mitigate high disk usage, consider expanding the VM's boot disk capacity.
     This action can help avoid performance issues and ensure smoother SSH connections.
     Follow the guide to increase disk size:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/resize-persistent-disk#increase_the_size_of_a_disk

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying VM CPU utilization is within optimal levels

   - gcpdiag-gce-faultyssh-runbook/faulty-windows-ssh                     [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     CPU utilization on this VM has surpassed recommended operational levels,
     which may affect its performance and SSH connectivity.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Excessive CPU usage can lead to performance bottlenecks. Consider resizing the VM to a more
     powerful machine type with higher CPU capabilities.
     Detailed instructions for resizing and restarting VMs are available here:
