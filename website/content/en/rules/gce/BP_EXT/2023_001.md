  Compute Engine scopes best practices

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: BP_EXT - (Extended) Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Google recommends enabling a custom service account with very fine-grained permissions
and a very restricted access scope so that you can ensure that access scopes to connect
to or from the VM is limited and implements a security-in-depth strategy where multiple
layers of security are used for holistic protection.

### Remediation
Please consider following the principle of least previlige and avoid using defaults service account for production applications. It is recommended to use a custom service account with restricted permissions that are required to your use case.
