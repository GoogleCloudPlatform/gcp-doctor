vpc/vm-external-ip-connectivity: Troubleshooting for common issues which affect VM connectivity to external IP addresses.

  This runbook investigates components required for VMs to establish connectivity
  to external IP addresses

  Areas Examined:

  - VM Instance Status: Evaluates the VM's current state, performance - ensuring that it is running
    and not impaired by high CPU usage, insufficient memory, or disk space issues that might disrupt
    normal operations.

  - VM Configuration: Checks the source nic configuration on the VM if it
    has an External IP address or not.

  - GCE Network Connectivity Tests: Reviews applicable routing and firewall rules to
    verify that there are no network barriers preventing the VM from connection to
    an external IP address.

  - NATGW Checks: For source nic without an External IP address,
    verify the VM is served by a Public NAT Gateway and check there are no issues on the NATGW.

       Firewall rule or policy exists which may deny egress traffic.
       Continue for connectivity test confirmation or apply remediation step and retest
