    - High Memory utilisation
    - Disk space high utilisation
    - High Disk IOPS utilisation
    - High Disk Throughput utilisation
    - Disk Health check
    - Check for Live Migrations
    - Usualy Error checks in Serial console logs
  
[START]: Fetching VM details
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying VM is in the RUNNING state...

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [OK]
     [REASON]
     The GCE VM faulty-linux-ssh is in the expected state: RUNNING.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying VM CPU utilization is within optimal levels

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     CPU utilization on this VM has surpassed recommended operational levels,
     which may affect its performance and SSH connectivity.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Excessive CPU usage can lead to performance bottlenecks. Consider resizing the VM to a more
     powerful machine type with higher CPU capabilities.
     Detailed instructions for resizing and restarting VMs are available here:
     - Stopping a VM: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stop-start-instance
     - Resizing a VM: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud
     Additionally, use the Compute Engine observability metrics for an in-depth analysis to pinpoint high-usage processes:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#access_vm_observability_metrics
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#process_utilization

     Alternatively, you can connect via serial console if SSH is unvailable to stop offending processes
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if CPU is overcommited

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     CPU for the VM faulty-linux-ssh is over committed beyond acceptable limits: 0 ms/s
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Verifying VM memory utilization is within optimal levels...

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Memory utilization on this VM has reached levels that may compromise its VM application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Elevated memory usage can result in slow or unresponsive or termimated applications.
     Consider enhancing the VM's memory capacity by changing to a machine type with more memory.
     Guidance on stopping and changing the machine type can be found here:
     - Changing machine type: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance#gcloud
     For deeper analysis of memory issues:

     Additionally, use the Compute Engine observability metrics for an in-depth analysis to pinpoint high-usage processes:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/observe-monitor-vms#memory_utilization

     Or connect via the Serial Console if SSH is not available to mitigate the issue.
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if there are any memory related errors in Serial logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     We did not find any Memory related errors in Serial console logs

     [REMEDIATION]
     You may check if VM is facing high memory utilisation from GuestOS side using `free -m`
     or `cat /proc/meminfo` commands.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if instance disks are healthy

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     You might experience slower/poor performance with your disk 'persistent-disk-0' due to an
     ongoing issue with our Compute Engine or Persistent Disk infrastructure. We're working
     to resolve this as quickly as possible.

     [REMEDIATION]
     To better understand the situation with your Compute Engine or Persistent Disks,
     could you please take a look at the Google Cloud Status page:

     https://status.cloud.google.com

     This page provides real-time updates on the health of Google Cloud services.

     Additionally, it may be helpful to check the Service Health dashboard in your
     Google Cloud Console for any reported incidents:

     https://console.cloud.google.com/servicehealth/incidents

     If you don't find any information about an ongoing issue related to your concern,
     please don't hesitate to reach out to Google Cloud Support by creating a support case.
     They'll be happy to investigate further and assist you.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if VM's Boot disk space utilization is within optimal levels.

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Disk utilization on this VM's boot disk is critically high,
     potentially affecting application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     To mitigate high disk usage, consider expanding the VM's boot disk capacity.
     This action can help avoid performance issues and ensure smoother SSH connections.
     Follow the guide to increase disk size:
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/resize-persistent-disk#increase_the_size_of_a_disk

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if any slow Disk operations related errors in Serial console logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     We did not find any slow Disk operations related errors in Serial console logs

     [REMEDIATION]


[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if any Filesystem corruption related errors in Serial console logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
