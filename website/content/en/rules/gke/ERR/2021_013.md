  GKE masters can reach the nodes.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Nodes must allow certain connections from the masters
(tcp:22 for public clusters, tcp:443 and tcp:10250 for private clusters).

The GKE control plane automatically creates firewall rules
to allow these connections, but if the connections get blocked, the following
could be the reason:

- The firewall rules couldn't be created (for example in a shared VPC scenario)
- The firewall rules were disabled or deleted
- There is a higher priority firewall rule configured for the VPC
- There is a firewall policy at the organization or folder level which
  blocks these connections.

### Remediation

The gcpdiag output should tell you if the connection was blocked by a firewall
rule or policy.
