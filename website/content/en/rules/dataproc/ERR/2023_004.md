  Dataproc cluster firewall rules for connectivity between master and worker nodes established!
---
**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong
### Description
The master node needs to communicate with the worker nodes during cluster
creation. Sometimes VM to VM communications are blocked by firewall rules.
### Remediation
- You can see the log from dataproc agent if the yarn app became orphaned and
killed by dataproc agent.
  Log query example :
  resource.type="cloud_dataproc_cluster" \
  resource.labels.cluster_uuid="<Datproc_cluster_uuid>" \
  "<YARN_app_id>" \
  logName: "projects/<project-name>/logs/google.dataproc.agent"
- Check for firewall rule warnings.
Make sure that the user has the correct firewall rule in place. Refer to the public documentation for the correct [Dataproc Cluster Network Configuration](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/network#overview).
To see what is blocking the master node from communicating with the worker nodes, a connectivity test can be performed by using the [Ad Hoc Connectivity Test](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/troubleshooting#cluster_creation_error_messages) found under "Network Intelligence" in your GCP console.
