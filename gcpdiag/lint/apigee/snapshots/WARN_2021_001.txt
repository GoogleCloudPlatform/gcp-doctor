*  apigee/WARN/2021_001: Every environment group contains at least one environment.
   - organizations/gcpdiag-apigee1-aaaa/envgroups/gcpdiag-demo-envgroup   [FAIL]
     No environment is attached to the environment group: gcpdiag-demo-envgroup
     All of the requests to the hostname list below will receive 404 errors: 
     ['gcpdiag.apigee.example.com']
   - organizations/gcpdiag-apigee1-aaaa/envgroups/gcpdiag-demo-envgroup-1 [ OK ]

   An environment must be a member of at least one environment group before you
   can access resources defined within it. In other words, you must assign an
   environment to a group before you can use it. Or you would receive 404 errors
   while accessing every hostname in the environment group.
