*  gcb/ERR/2022_003: Builds don't fail because of retention policy set on logs bucket.
   - gcpdiag-gcb1-aaaa/58c22070-5629-480e-b822-cd8eff7befb8               [FAIL]
     Build can not stream logs to bucket gcpdiag-gcb1-bucket1-aaaa because it has retention policy set.

   Builds that upload logs to bucket with retention policy must do that once
   build is finished instead of streaming them.
