   A private cluster is a type of VPC-native cluster that only depends on
   internal IP addresses. Nodes, Pods, and Services in a private cluster require
   unique subnet IP address ranges.  Private clusters are used when the
   applications and services are needed to be isolated from the outside
   connections completely. This ensures the workloads are private and not
   exposed to untrusted sources.
