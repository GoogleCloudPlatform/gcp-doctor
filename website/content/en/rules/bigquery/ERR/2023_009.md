  BigQuery job not failed due to Scheduled query with multiple DML
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Destination/Target dataset can only be set up for scheduled queries with one
single DML statement. When two DML statements are present the second DML
statement will not pick up the correct destination/target dataset and will throw
an error.

### Remediation
Recreate the scheduled query and make sure that the Target/Destination dataset
`(--target_dataset)` value is not explicitly being set.
