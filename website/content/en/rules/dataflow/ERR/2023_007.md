  Streaming Dataflow job gets stuck when firewall rules are not configured
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

When Streaming Engine is disabled, Dataflow workers communicate
over port 12345 to shuffle intermediate data. Job will get stuck
if the required firewall rules are not present to allow communication
between workers. Issue occurs only when a job runs with more than one worker.

### Remediation

Configure necessary Firewall rules to allow communication between Dataflow workers over port 12345.
