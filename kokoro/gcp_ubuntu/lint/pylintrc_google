# Pylint does not support some Google rc config features and required that I make the following small changes to the google rc file that was found here:
# https://cs.corp.google.com/piper///depot/google3/devtools/gpylint/config/base/rc

# Change 1) “output-format=sorted-text” TO “output-format=text”
# Change 2) “msg-template={msg_id}:{line:3}{obj_prefix}{obj}: {msg}{sym_separator}[{symbol}]” TO “msg-template={msg_id}:{line:3}{obj}: {msg}-[{symbol}]”

# Pickle collected data for later comparisons.
persistent=no

# Set the cache size for astng objects.
