  Cloud Composer's worker concurrency is not limited by parallelism parameter
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

The parallelism defines the maximum number of task instances that can run
concurrently in Airflow. Generally, the parameter should be equal or higher than
a product of maximum number of workers and worker_concurrency. Otherwise,
resources in workers could not be fully-utilized.

### Remediation

Observe your environment's performance and adjust `parallelism` or
`worker_concurrency` parameter properly.
