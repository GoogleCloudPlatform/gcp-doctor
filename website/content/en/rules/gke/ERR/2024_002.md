  GKE Webhook failures can seriously impact GKE Cluster.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Impact typically depends on the webhook failure policy and what type of GKE API
are handled by the webhook.

In some cases, a failing customer created webhook can render a cluster unusable
until corrected. Inability to create Pod (and similar)can lead to system pod not
getting scheduled / new pod not reaching a healthy state.
