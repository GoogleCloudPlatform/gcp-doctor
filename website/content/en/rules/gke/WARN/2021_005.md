  GKE nodes have good disk performance.

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description


Disk performance is essential for the proper operation of GKE nodes. If
too much IO is done and the disk latency gets too high, system components
can start to misbehave. Often the boot disk is a bottleneck because it is
used for multiple things: the operating system, docker images, container
filesystems (usually including /tmp, etc.), and EmptyDir volumes.
