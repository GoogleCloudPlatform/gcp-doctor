  NodeLocal DNSCache timeout errors.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong


### Description

On clusters with NodeLocal DNSCache enabled sometimes response to a DNS request was not received from kube-dns in 2 seconds and hence the DNS timeout errors crop up.

You can use the following filter to find matching log lines:
```
textPayload:"[ERROR] plugin/errors: 2"
resource.type="k8s_container"
```

### Remediation

Increase the number of kube-dns replicas.
