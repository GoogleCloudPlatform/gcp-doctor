  GKE clusters complies with the serial port logging organization policy.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

When the constraints/compute.disableSerialPortLogging organization policy is enabled,
GKE clusters must be created with logging disabled (serial-port-logging-enable: 'false'),
otherwise the creation will fail.


### Remediation
Cluster metadata and nodepool metadata can be defined only during the creation and they cannot be modified afterwards.
If cluster was initially created with "serial-port-logging-enable: 'true'" and the organization policy was enabled after that, all new node pools have to be created with explicit "serial-port-logging-enable: 'false'"
1) gcloud container clusters create example-cluster \
--metadata serial-port-logging-enable=false
2) gcloud container node-pools create node-pool-1 \
--cluster=example-cluster --metadata serial-port-logging-enable=false
