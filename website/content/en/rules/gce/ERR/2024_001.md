  Snapshot creation not failed due to rate limit.

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

When you try to snapshot your disk more than once during a ten minute period, or
issue more than six burst snapshot requests in 60 minutes, you will encounter
rate exceeded error. Follow best practices for disk snapshots.

### Remediation

[To resolve this issue](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-snapshots#creating_snapshots_from_persistent_disks), take a snapshot of the disk at most once per hour as a best practice. Avoid taking snapshots more often than that. The easiest way to achieve this is to set up a snapshot schedule.
