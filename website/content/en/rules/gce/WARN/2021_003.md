  GCE VM Instance Access Scope, GCE VM Attached Service Account Permissions and APIs Required for Monitoring.
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

A GCP project should have Cloud Monitoring API enabled.

The service account attached to the GCE VM instances should have the
monitoring.metricWriter IAM role permission.

Also, a GCE instance should have the monitoring.write access scope.

Without these, Ops Agent won't be able to collect metrics from GCE VMs and
display on Metrics Explorer.

### Remediation
Make sure that you have [enabled the Cloud Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/enable-api) in your GCP project.

Make sure that you have the following role binding in the IAM policy:

- Principal: service account attached to the GCE VM instance
- Role: [`roles/monitoring.metricWriter`](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/access-control#grant-monitoring-access)

Make sure that the GCE VM instance has one of the following [access scopes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/change-service-account#changeserviceaccountandscopes):

- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform (default)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write
