**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

BigQuery encountered a "Exceeded rate limits" error. This means the number of
queries simultaneously using remote functions surpassed a predefined
threshold to ensure system stability. To avoid overloading the system,
BigQuery restricts the number of concurrent operations.

### Remediation
