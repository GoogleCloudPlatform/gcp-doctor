  Policy constraint 'AutomaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts' is enforced
---

**Product**: [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://cloud.google.com/iam)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description
Policy constraint [AutomaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#automatic-role-grants)
is strongly recommended to be enforced in production projects according to security best practices.

According to security best practices, admins should limit as much as possible the permission set
of all users and service accounts of a project. This policy Constraint will prevent the automatic
'editor' role grant to default service accounts [zero trust
approach](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/what-zero-trust-identity-security)

### Remediation
To improve security, we strongly recommend that you [disable the automatic role grant](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-service-accounts#disable_service_account_default_grants).
Use the iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts boolean constraint to disable
the automatic role grant.
[Turn on the policy constraint enforcement using gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/resource-manager/org-policies/enable-enforce)
