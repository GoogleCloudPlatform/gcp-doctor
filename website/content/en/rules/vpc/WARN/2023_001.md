  On-premises host can communicate with the setvice producer's network
---

**Product**: [Virtual Private Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vpc)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

When you create a private connection,  the VPC network and service producer's
network only exchange subnet routes by default.

Enabling the export of custom routes to this private connection allows
on-premises hosts to access the service producer's network via private
services access.

### Remediation

In your VPC network, [update the peering connection](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-vpc-peering#update-peer-connection) to export custom routes to the service producer's network.

### Further information

See [On-premises hosts can't communicate with the service producer's network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-services-access#on-prem).
