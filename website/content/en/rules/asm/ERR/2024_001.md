  Getting timed out error for secret not found for ingress gateway
---

**Product**: [Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/anthos)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

When deploying Ingress gateway which is using a secret, you may get the
following error:
gRPC config: initial fetch timed out for type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.
transport_sockets.tls.v3.Secret

This means Ingress gateway is trying to get certs but failing. This could mean
istiod is denying the requests or otherwise cannot access them.

### Remediation

One possible solution is to confirm if the secret exists in the given namespace.
You can use the command `kubectl get secrets -n <namespace>` to verify the
existence of secret. One way to check is by looking at the audit logs to confirm
if the secret was deleted somehow.

### Further information

- Further, checking the Istiod logs will likely give more info.
