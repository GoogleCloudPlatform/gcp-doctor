  Each topic has at least one subscription attached.

**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Without a subscription, subscribers cannot pull messages or receive pushed
messages published to the topic. At the end of the max message retention period,
the messages will be discarded from Pub/Sub regardless, resulting in loss of
data published to the topic.

### Remediation

[Attach a subscription](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber) to the
topic in order to deliver messages published to the topic before they expire
and are discarded leading to data loss.

Once the subscription is attached, depending on the type of the subscription,
simply pull from it for pull subscriptions, or accept delivered messages to
your configured endpoint for push messages.
