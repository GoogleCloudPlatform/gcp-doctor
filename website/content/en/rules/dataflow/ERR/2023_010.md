  Dataflow job using streaming insert did not fail due to missing required field.
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The Dataflow job writing to bigquery using streaming inserts can fail due to missing required field.

### Remediation

BigQuery streaming insert request has wrong rows resulting in Missing required
field error. This means a row missed certain column or column is set as null.
The missing column value can be found from error message in the logs of
dataflow job id .
Need to fix the pipeline code to put column values correctly.
