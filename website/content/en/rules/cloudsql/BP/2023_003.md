  Cloud SQL instance's log_output flag is not configured as TABLE
---

**Product**: [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

If you set log_output to TABLE, the log output is placed in a table in the mysql
system database. It might consume a considerable amount of disk space. If this
table becomes large, it can affect instance restart time or cause the instance
to lose its SLA coverage. For this reason, the TABLE option is not recommended.

### Remediation

Change the `log_output` flag to `FILE` or `NONE`. Note that to minimize instance
storage cost, logs on the instance disk are rotated when the log file is older
than 24 hours (and no changes have been made within that duration) or greater
than 100MB in size. Old log files are automatically deleted after the rotation.
