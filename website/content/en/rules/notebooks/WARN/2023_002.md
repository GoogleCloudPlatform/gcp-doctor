  Vertex AI Workbench instance is in healthy data disk space status
---

**Product**: [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

The data disk space status is unhealthy if the disk space is greater than 85%
full.

### Remediation

If your data disk space status is unhealthy, try the following:

 - From a terminal session in the user-managed notebooks instance or [using ssh to connect](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/troubleshooting-workbench#ssh-connect), check the amount of free disk space using the command `df -h -T /home/jupyter`.
 - Delete large files to increase the available disk space. Use the command `find . -type d -size +100M` to help you find large files.
 - If the previous steps don't solve your problem, [get support](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/support/getting-support).
