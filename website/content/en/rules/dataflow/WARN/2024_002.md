  Dataflow job using Streaming Appliance is not getting stuck due to Commit failed: computation doesn't have the state family.
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

A Dataflow job running with Streaming Appliance may get stuck and return the below warnings during its execution:

Commit failed: computation doesn't have the state family

You can search this in Logs Explorer for such jobs with the below mentioned Logging Query:

      """
      resource.type="dataflow_step"
      resource.labels.job_id="%dataflowJobID%"
      "Commit failed: computation doesn't have the state family"
      severity>="WARNING"
      """

This warning will not be visible for jobs using Streaming Engine as we proactively reject such problematic pipelines, however in Appliance jobs, it may get into a bad state and become stuck.

### Remediation

This is a known issue when updating pipelines that have a flatten operation followed by a ParDo that uses a side input. The workaround is to change the pipeline shape to avoid this issue. For example if the pipeline looks something like:

 ParDo                     ParDo
   \                          /
    \                        /
       A flatten operation
              |
              |
      ParDo using side input
              |
            Output


The recommended work-around is to change this to something like:


   ParDo                                  ParDo
      \                                    /
       \                                  /
ParDo using side input          ParDo using side input
             \                       /
              \                     /
                A flatten operation
                        |
                        |
                      Output
