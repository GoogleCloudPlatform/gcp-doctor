  Project should not have a subscription without a topic attached.
---

**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

For a subscription whose topic is deleted, it cannot be reattached to a new
topic and thus cannot receive new published messages. Messages in the
subscription will expire after the message retention period if unacked,
and discarded from Pub/Sub which may lead to data loss.
The subscription is then counting as quota consumed for an unusable resource.

### Remediation

[Delete a subscription](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/delete-subscriptions)
whose topic is deleted to free up [the quota](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas#resource_limits)
for new subscriptions.

### Further information

You can also set expiration policy for subscriptions to delete inactive
subscriptions past their expiry period. By default this value is [31 days](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscription-properties#expiration_period).
However, subscriptions set to `never expire` will not be deleted even if they
are inactive and count against the project's quota usage.
