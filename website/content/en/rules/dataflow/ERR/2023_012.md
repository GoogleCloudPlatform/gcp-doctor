  Dataflow job writing to spanner did not fail due to OOM.
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The Dataflow job writing to spanner can fail in case of out of memory errors.

To write data to spanner, The SpannerIO package in Beam's Java sdk provides a write transform.
It uses SpannerIO.write() transform to execute a collection of input row mutations.
The Dataflow connector groups mutations into batches for efficiency.
Given a PCollection of Mutations – SpannerIO.Write groups, sorts and batches the
mutations on the primary key and applies the mutations on Spanner.

SpannerIO uses local memory for creating batches of sorted mutations which can
lead to high memory consumption

### Remediation

There are several options to address high memory consumption by SpannerIO.write():
- increase the machine type/memory [machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource#recommendations_for_machine_types)
- reducing the [number_of_worker_harness_threads](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/pipeline-options#:~:text=numberOfWorkerHarnessThreads)
- alter the
SpannerIO.write() parameters to reduce the amount of data that needs to be
stored in memory
- disable Sorting by setting .withGroupingFactor(1) (negatively affects performance of SpannerIO.write())
- disable Sorting and Batching by setting .withMaxNumMutations(0) (negatively affects performance of SpannerIO.write())

The latter can be done using the SpannerIO.write() parameters. For example: SpannerIO.write().withBatchSizeBytes
(100_000).withMaxNumMutations(500).withGroupingFactor(100) will use approx
1/10th of the memory.
