  Dataproc cluster has sufficient quota
---
**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong
### Description
When creating a Dataproc cluster, your project must have available quotas for
the resources you request, such as CPU, disk, and IP addresses. If your request
exceeds your project's quotas, the cluster creation will fail.

### Remediation
- You can search the logs to check on the quota error.

  Log query example :

  severity=ERROR
  protoPayload.status.message=~"Insufficient"
  resource.type="cloud_dataproc_cluster"

- You can raise a request to [increase quota limit](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quota)
