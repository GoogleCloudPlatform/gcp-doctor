  Cloud Dataproc Service Account has a Dataproc Worker role.
---

**Product**: [Cloud Data Fusion](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The Dataproc Worker role provides the VM service account with the minimum permissions necessary to operate with Dataproc. To create a cluster with a user-specified service account, the specified service account must have all permissions granted by the Dataproc Worker role

### Remediation

Add an IAM policy binding to a Cloud Dataproc service account by specifying a role. The Service Account cannot be created without a role. For example, this can be done using the [GCP Console](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/docs/how-to/granting-service-account-permission#grant_roles_to_service_accounts) or by running the following gcloud tool command:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member='serviceAccount:<project-id>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com' --role='roles/dataproc.worker'
```
