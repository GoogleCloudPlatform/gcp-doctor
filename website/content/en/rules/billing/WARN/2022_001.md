  Projects have billing enabled

**Product**: [Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Check whether all projects the user has permission to view have billing enabled.

GCP services, require an active billing account attached to the project in order to be activated, and remain active.

Disabling billing for a project will stop all the active paid resources immediately.

If the project continues without a Billing Account attached for a long time, some resources may be deleted unrecoverably after an undertemined but short amount of time.
