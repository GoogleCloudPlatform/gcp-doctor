  BigQuery copy job does not exceed the cross-region daily copy quota
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

The copy job fails because the number of cross-region copy jobs running in a project has
exceeded the daily limit.
You can search in the Logs Explorer with the logging query:
```
resource.type="bigquery_resource"
severity=ERROR
("Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for cross region copies per project."
OR
"Quota exceeded: Your table exceeded quota for cross region copies per table.")
```

### Remediation

- Retry after the daily quota is refreshed
- You can request a quota increase by contacting support or sales. It might take several days to
  review and process the request. We recommend stating the priority, use case, and the project ID
  in the request.
