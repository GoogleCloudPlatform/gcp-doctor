"""Cloud SQL is configured with automated backup

Backups help you restore lost data to your Cloud SQL instance. Additionally,
if an instance is having a problem, you can restore it to a previous state by
using the backup to overwrite it. Enable automated backups for any instance that
contains necessary data. Backups protect your data from loss or damage.
