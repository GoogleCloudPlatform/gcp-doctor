**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Google recommends Compute Engine instances to be configured with
Google NTP servers to facilitate reliable time sync. Google can't predict how
external NTP services behave. If at all possible, it is recommended that you do
not use external NTP sources with Compute Engine virtual machines.

### Remediation
- [Configure](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/configure-ntp#configure_ntp_for_your_instances) VM to use Google NTP Server
