  Cloud SQL instance's avg CPU utilization is not over 98% for 6 hours
---

**Product**: [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

If CPU utilization is over 98% for six hours, your instance is not properly
sized for your workload, and it is not covered by the SLA.

### Remediation

[Increase the number of CPUs for your
instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/edit-instance). Note that changing CPUs requires
an instance restart. If your instance is already at the maximum number of CPUs,
shard your database to multiple instances.
