  Vertex AI Workbench instance is in healthy boot disk space status
---

**Product**: [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

The boot disk space status is unhealthy if the disk space is greater than 85%
full.

### Remediation

If your boot disk space status is unhealthy, try the following:

 - From a terminal session in the user-managed notebooks instance or using ssh to connect, check the amount of free disk space using the command `df -H`.
 - Use the command `find . -type d -size +100M` to help you find large files that you might be able to delete, but don't delete them unless you are sure you can safely do so. If you aren't sure, you can [get help from support](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/support/getting-support).
 - If the previous steps don't solve your problem, [get support](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/support/getting-support).
