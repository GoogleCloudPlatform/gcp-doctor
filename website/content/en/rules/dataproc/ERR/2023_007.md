**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description
User is attempting to create a dataproc cluster in a region or zone that doesn't have enough/required resources to successfully provision and create the cluster.

Resources can include :
- Certain machine types (compute optimized, memory optimised, GPUs)
- Multiple very large persistent disks capacity of same disk type


### Remediation

- Try a different zone or region: If you are experiencing a zonal stockout, try deploying your workload to a different zone in the same region. If you are experiencing a regional stockout, try deploying your workload to a different region.

- Try retrying your request in a while. This can be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, but it depends on the resources, region, and popularity.

- Contact support: If you are unable to resolve the stockout on your own or a specific zone is needed, you can contact Google Cloud support for assistance.



### Further information

- We recommend to use [autozone](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/auto-zone)  for resource provisioning and reservation

- We recommend also to explore [partial clusters](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-partial-cluster) for increasing availability
