 Verify that GCE VM Instances Don't Have Legacy Monitoring Agent Installed.
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

This rule checks that no GCE VMs in the GCP project use the [legacy Monitoring Agent](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/monitoring/installation).

It leverages two public GCP APIs for detection:
1. The [OS Config API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/osconfig/rest) (to check installed packages).
2. The [Cloud Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3) (to examine agent uptime metrics).

The rule queries the [OS Config API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/osconfig/rest) first, and uses [Cloud Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3) as a fallback. If the agent is detected in either location, the rule fails.
If neither API is enabled or both APIs return an empty result, the rule skips the VM as it cannot determine the legacy agent installation status.

It's recommended to [enable VM Manager](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/manage-os#automatic) which enables OS Config API automatically to guarantee the rule's ability to detect the legacy monitoring agent.

We recommend transitioning to the [Ops Agent](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/ops-agent), which consolidates logging and monitoring into a single, actively supported solution. It's designed as the eventual replacement for the [legacy Monitoring Agent](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/monitoring/installation).


### Remediation
To resolve the rule violation, please [uninstall](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/monitoring/installation#uninstall) the legacy Monitoring Agent from any affected VMs.
Please also [install](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/ops-agent/installation#joint-install) the Ops Agent for continued monitoring.
