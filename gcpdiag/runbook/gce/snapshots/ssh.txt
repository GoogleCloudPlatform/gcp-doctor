gce/ssh: Analyzes typical factors that might impede SSH connectivity

Investigates the following for a single windows or linux VM:

- VM Instance Status: Inspects the VM's lifecycle, CPU, memory, and disk status.
- User Permissions: Verifies Google Cloud IAM permissions necessary for utilizing
  OS login and metadata-based SSH keys.
- VM Configuration: Verifies the presence or absence of required metadata.
- Network connectivity tests: Inspects firewall rules to ensure user can reach the VM.
