  A multi-region setup requires a separate MIG for each region.
---

**Product**: [Apigee API Management](https://cloud.google.com/apigee)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

If Apigee X instances exist in multiple regions, then a MIG should be created
in each region. Otherwise the traffic will only be routed to one region.

### Remediation

If you are provisioning Apigee X with VPC peering by using MIGs (Managed Instance Groups),
you need to create a MIG for each of the region where you created an Apigee X instance. You
can follow the documentation for [External routing (MIG)](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/get-started/install-cli-paygo#external-routing-mig)
and repeat Steps 8b and 8c for each region.
