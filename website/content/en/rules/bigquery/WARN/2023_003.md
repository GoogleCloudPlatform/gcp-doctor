  BigQuery query job does not fail with too many output columns error
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

This issue is caused when a job cannot be completed within a memory budget because of the possibility of user's schema being too large and nested.

### Remediation

The number of columns is the highest contributor to memory footprint and reducing the number of columns would be the best workaround for this issue.
