**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description


GKE includes some system workloads running in the user-managed nodes which are
essential for the correct operation of the cluster. We verify that restart count
of containers in one of the system namespaces (kube-system, istio-system,
custom-metrics) stayed stable in the last 24 hours.
