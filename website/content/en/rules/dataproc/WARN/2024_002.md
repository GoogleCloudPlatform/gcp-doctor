  HDFS can write file(s) to DataNode(s).
---

**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

HDFS had issues writing file(s) to DataNode(s). The HDFS NameNode logs show the following message:
```
java.io.IOException: File [...] could only be [written/replicated] to x nodes instead of minReplication (=n). There are y datanode(s) running and z node(s) are excluded in this operation.
```

This can be caused by different reasons:
- The HDFS filesystem has no available space.

- The DataNodes may be unavailable or there is no communication between NameNode and Datanode(s).

- The reserved space for non-DFS use is not sufficient (`dfs.datanode.du.reserved`).


### Remediation

- Check the [HDFS remaining capacity](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/dataproc-metrics#hdfs_metrics): dfs/FSNamesystem/CapacityRemainingGB.
  - If low, free up some HDFS space or add primary worker nodes to the cluster.

- Check the status of NameNode and DataNodes services and the related logs.
  - Address the issue based on the findings, e.g. network related issues related to the communication between NameNode and Datanodes.
