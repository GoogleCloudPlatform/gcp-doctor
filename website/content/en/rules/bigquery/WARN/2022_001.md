  BigQuery does not exceed rate limits
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

BigQuery has various quotas that limit the rate and volume of incoming
requests. These quotas exist both to protect the backend systems, and to help
guard against unexpected billing if you submit large jobs.

### Remediation

Slow down the request rate. To resolve these limit issues, retry the operation
after few seconds. Use exponential backoff between retry attempts. If you
consistently reach one of these longer-term quota limits, you should analyze
your workload for ways to mitigate the issue. Mitigations can include optimizing
your workload or requesting a quota increase.

### Further information

To diagnose issues, do the following:
* Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA views to analyze the underlying issue. These views
contain metadata about your BigQuery resources, including jobs, reservations,
and streaming inserts. For example, the following query uses the
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS view to list all quota-related errors within the past
day:

```
SELECT
 job_id,
 creation_time,
 error_result
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS
WHERE creation_time > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 1 DAY) AND
      error_result.reason IN ('rateLimitExceeded', 'quotaExceeded')
```

* View errors in Cloud Audit Logs
Using Logs Explorer, the following query returns errors with either Quota
exceeded or limit in the message string:

```
resource.type = ("bigquery_project" OR "bigquery_dataset")
protoPayload.status.code ="7"
protoPayload.status.message: ("Quota exceeded" OR "limit")
```
