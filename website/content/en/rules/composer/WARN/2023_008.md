  Cloud Composer Airflow database is in healthy state
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

The Airflow monitoring pod pings the database every minute and reports health
status as True if a SQL connection can be established or False if not. Note that
the environment health could be intermittently unhealthy due to events like
scheduled maintenances. However, overall it should be healthy.

### Remediation

To check the health of your database, you can use the following health status
metric: composer.googleapis.com/environment/database_health.

Otherwise, you can check if there was a maintenance operation aligned with the
unhealthy time frame from the [monitoring dashboard](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/use-monitoring-dashboard#environment-overview).
Note that maintenance operations happen during the configured maintenance
window. If your current maintenance window does not fit to your business
requirements, please consider changing it.
