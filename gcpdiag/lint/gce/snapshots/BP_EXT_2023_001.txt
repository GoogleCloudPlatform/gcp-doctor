   Google recommends not to rely on access scopes but instead set the cloud-
   platform access scope and control the service account access by granting
   fine-grained IAM roles. Enabling a custom service account with very coarse-
   grained permissions and a very restricted access scope will ensure the
   connection to or from the VM is limited and implements a security-in-depth
   strategy where multiple layers of security are used for holistic protection.
