description: >
  Splunk HEC endpoint uses a valid public SSL certificate, or a correct root-CA certificate is provided.
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The Dataflow job will fail if the root-CA certificate provided is not the
correct one or if the endpoint is not signed by a valid issuer.
Check that the issuer for the certificate is
valid and the correct certificate is provided.

### Remediation
Use a valid `rootCaCertificatePath` path parameter as [shown in this template](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/templates/provided/pubsub-to-splunk#template-parameters).
