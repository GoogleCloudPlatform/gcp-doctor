  Job driver logs are enabled in Stackdriver Logging
---

**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Enabling stackdriver logging for your dataproc cluster impacts the ability to troubleshoot any issues that you might have.

If you are a Google Cloud Support customer, keeping system logging and monitoring enabled is important even if you have your own monitoring solution, because otherwise the support team wonâ€™t have access to logs and monitoring data used for troubleshooting. This is the more relevant when creating ephemeral clusters.

### Remediation

Verify that dataproc property dataproc.logging.stackdriver.job.driver.enable is set to "true".

To enable job driver logs in Logging, set the following cluster property when [creating the cluster](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/cluster-properties#service_properties):
