  GCE snapshot policies are defined only for used disks

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description
GCE snapshot policies are defined only for used disks.
Schedule snapshots on unused disk are unnecessary
since disk delta doesn't change.

### Remediation
1. Verify the disk hasn't been detached by mistake from the VM, else
remove the schedule snapshot policy from such a disk.
2. A point in time snapshot should suffice (manual snapshot)
