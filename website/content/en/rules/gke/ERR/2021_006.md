  GKE Autoscaler isn't reporting scaleup failures.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description


If the GKE autoscaler reported a problem when trying to add nodes
to a cluster, it could mean that you don't have enough resources
to accomodate for new nodes. E.g. you might not have enough free
IP addresses in the GKE cluster network.

Suggested Cloud Logging query:
resource.type="gce_instance" AND log_id(cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity) AND
severity=ERROR AND protoPayload.methodName="v1.compute.instances.insert" AND
protoPayload.requestMetadata.callerSuppliedUserAgent="GCE Managed Instance Group for GKE"
