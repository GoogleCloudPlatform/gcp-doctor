*  gce/WARN/2021_001: GCE instance service account permissions for logging.
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/gce1                                               [FAIL]
     service account: 12340001-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
     missing role: roles/logging.logWriter

     missing role: roles/logging.logWriter
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/mig-kmm1                                           [FAIL]
     missing scope: logging.write
     no service account
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/mig-zd52                                           [FAIL]
     missing scope: logging.write
     no service account

   The service account used by GCE instance should have the logging.logWriter
   permission and a GCE instance should have the logging.write access scope,
   otherwise, if you install the logging agent, it won't be able to send the
   logs to Cloud Logging.
