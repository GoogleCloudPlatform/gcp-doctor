*  gce/WARN/2022_002: Instance groups named ports are using unique names.
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/gke-gke1-default-pool-35923fbc-grp                 [ OK ]
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/instance-group-1                                   [FAIL]
     Instance group contains multiple ports with the same name
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/instance-group-2                                   [ OK ]
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/mig                                                [ OK ]

   Named ports are key-value pairs that represent a port's name and number. It
   is recommended to use unique port name for the same application, so that
   backend service can only forward traffic to one named port at a time.
