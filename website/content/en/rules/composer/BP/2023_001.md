  Cloud Composer logging level is set to INFO

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Logging level of Airflow may have been set to DEBUG for troubleshooting
purposes. However, it is highly recommended to revert the logging level
back to INFO after the troubleshooting is completed. Leaving the logging
level at DEBUG might increase costs associated with Cloud Storage. Logging
levels higher than INFO (WARNING, ERROR) could suppress logs that are useful
to troubleshooting, so it also not recommended.

### Remediation

Revert the logging level back to INFO.
