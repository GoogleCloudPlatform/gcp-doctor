  Workloads not reporting misconfigured CNI plugins
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Workloads in cluster are unable to setup pod networking which
is likely to fail here due to CNI plugin issue.

Check for any recent changes in your CNI plugin.
Verify working and non working node's /etc/cni content.
Rebuild the node if CNI is broken.

You can use the following filter to find matching log lines:

```
jsonPayload.MESSAGE =~"CreatePodSandbox for pod failed.* failed to setup network for sandbox"
resource.type="k8s_node"
```
