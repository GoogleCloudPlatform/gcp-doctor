  Calculate GCE VM's IOPS and Throughput Limits

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: BP_EXT - (Extended) Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

This lint rules provide a easy method to calculate the Instance's
disk IOPS and Throughput applicable limits and current usage.

### Remediation

To understand a VM's storage performance, [view performance metrics](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance#viewing-performance-metrics)
for Throughput, Operations (IOPS), I/O Size, I/O Latency, and Queue Length.

Disk throughput and IOPS indicate whether the VM workload is operating as expected.
If throughput or IOPS is lower than the expected maximum listed in the [disk type chart](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance#type_comparison), then I/O size, queue length, or I/O latency performance
issues might be present.

You can expect I/O size to be between 4-16 KiB for workloads that require high IOPS and
low latency, and 256 KiB-1 MiB for workloads that involve sequential or large write sizes.
I/O size outside of these ranges indicate disk performance issues.

Queue length, also known as queue depth, is a factor of throughput and IOPS. When a disk
performs well, its queue length should be about the same as the queue length recommended
to achieve a particular throughput or IOPS level, listed in the [Recommended I/O queue depth](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/optimizing-pd-performance#io-queue-depth) chart.

I/O latency is dependent on queue length and I/O size. If the queue length or I/O size for
a disk is high, the latency will also be high.

If any storage performance metrics indicate disk performance issues, do one or more of the following:

- Review [Optimizing Persistent Disk performance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/optimizing-pd-performance) or [Optimize Hyperdisk performance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/optimize-hyperdisk)
and implement the best practices suggested to improve performance.
- [Attach a new persistent disk to the VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk) or [Add Hyperdisk storage to a VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-hyperdisk) to increase the disk performance
limits. Disk performance is based on the total amount of storage attached to an instance.
This option is the least disruptive as it does not require a you to unmount the file system,
restart, or shutdown the instance.
- Modify the [Hyperdisk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/modify-hyperdisks) to increase the per-disk IOPS and throughput limits. For Persistent Disk, you must [increase the size of the disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/resize-persistent-disk) to increase the per-disk IOPS and throughput limits. Disks don't have any reserved, unusable capacity,
so you can use the full disk without performance degradation.
- [Change the disk type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/modify-persistent-disk#disk_type) to a disk type that offers higher performance.
