  Having the composer API enabled ensures the environment remains in a healthy state.

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Disabling the Cloud Composer's service (API) puts Composer environments into a
permanent failed state, and permanently deletes the Composer tenant project.
Make sure that all Cloud Composer environments in your project are deleted.

### Remediation

Any of these error messages may appear as a banner on the Environment details page in Console:

  - ```This environment cannot be edited due to the errors that occurred during environment creation/update. Please investigate the logs to determine the cause, or create a new environment.```
  - ```An error occurred with retrieving the last operation on this environment```
  - ```The most recent update failed due to below error.The environment has been set to ERROR state permanently due to deactivation of the Cloud Composer service API.```
  - ```ERROR: (gcloud.beta.composer.environments.restart-web-server) FAILED_PRECONDITION: Cannot update environment in state ERROR. Environment must be in RUNNING state.```

1. Re-enable the Composer API ([public doc](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/enable-composer-service)).
2. Note that re-enabling the API will **NOT** restore old Composer environments which entered into the permanent failed state.
3. Create a new Composer environment.
4. Delete the old environment, which cannot be recovered.
