**Rule class**: SEC - Potential security issue

### Description

Your SQL instance has 0.0.0.0/0 as an allowed network.
This occurrence means that any IPv4 client can pass the network firewall
and make login attempts to your instance,
including clients you might not have intended to allow.
Clients still need valid credentials to successfully log in to your instance.
