  Vertex AI Workbench instance is not being OOMKilled
---

**Product**: [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

High memory utilization more than 85% in the user-managed notebooks instance
could be a cause of 524 (A Timeout Occurred) errors while opening Jupyterlab.

### Remediation

Verify memory utilization in the user-managed notebooks instance.

1. [Connect to your Deep Learning VM instance using SSH](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance).

2. Run the `free -t -h` command. If the **used** memory is above 85% of the **total**, you should consider [changing the machine type](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/manage-hardware-accelerators).

3. You can [install Cloud Monitoring agent](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/monitoring/installation#joint-install) to monitor if there is high memory usage in your user-managed notebooks instance. See [pricing information](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing#monitoring-costs).
