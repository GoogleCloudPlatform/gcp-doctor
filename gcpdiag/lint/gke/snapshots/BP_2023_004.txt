      is not VPC-native

   It's recommended to use VPC-native clusters. VPC-native clusters use alias IP
   address ranges on GKE nodes and are required for private GKE clusters and for
   creating clusters on Shared VPCs, as well as many other features.  VPC-native
   clusters scale more easily than routes-based clusters without consuming
   Google Cloud routes and so are less susceptible to hitting routing limits.
