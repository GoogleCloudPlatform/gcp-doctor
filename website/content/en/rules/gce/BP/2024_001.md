 GCE VM instances don't have Legacy Monitoring Agent installed.
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

This rule checks that no GCE VMs in the GCP project use the [legacy Monitoring Agent](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/monitoring/installation).

It leverages two public GCP APIs for detection:
1. The [OS Config API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/osconfig/rest) (to check installed packages).
2. The [Cloud Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3) (to examine agent uptime metrics).

The rule queries the [OS Config API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/osconfig/rest) first, and uses [Cloud Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3) as a fallback. If the agent is detected in either location, the rule fails.

It's recommended to [enable OS Config API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/manage-os#enable-service-api) to guarantee the rule's ability to detect the legacy monitoring agent.

We recommend transitioning to the [Ops Agent](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/ops-agent), which consolidates logging and monitoring into a single, actively supported solution. It's designed as the eventual replacement for the [legacy Monitoring Agent](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/monitoring/installation).


### Remediation
To resolve the rule violation, please [uninstall](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/monitoring/installation#uninstall) the legacy Monitoring Agent from any affected VMs.
Please also [install](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/agents/ops-agent/installation#joint-install) the Ops Agent for continued monitoring.
