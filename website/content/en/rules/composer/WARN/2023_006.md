  Airflow schedulers are healthy for the last hour
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Airflow schedulers report heartbeat signals every predefined interval called
scheduler_heartbeat_sec (default: 5 seconds). If any heartbeats are received
within the threshold time (default: 30 seconds), the Scheduler heartbeat from
the monitoring dashboard is marked as Green, which means healthy. Otherwise the
status is unhealthy. Note that if your environment has more than one scheduler,
then the status is healthy as long as at least one of schedulers is responding.

### Remediation

Identify if the issue happens at DAG parse time or while processing tasks at
execution time. For more information about symptoms, see [Troubleshooting Airflow scheduler issues](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/troubleshooting-scheduling).

For issues at DAG parse time, inspect DAG Processor logs and increase parameters
related to DAG parsing (dagbag-import-timeout, dag-file-processor-timeout) if
there are DAGs not parsed properly. Otherwise, fix or remove DAGs that cause
problems to the DAG processor.

For issues at execution time, make sure that airflow-scheduler pods of the GKE
cluster are not overloaded. If you can find singns of being overloaded like CPU
usage hitting limit, restarting due to OOMKilled or ephemeral storage usage is
reaching its limit, [adjust scheduler scale and performance
parameters](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/scale-environments#workloads-configuration) properly.
