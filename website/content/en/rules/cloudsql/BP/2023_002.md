### Description

Backups help you restore lost data to your Cloud SQL instance. Additionally,
if an instance is having a problem, you can restore it to a previous state by
using the backup to overwrite it. Enable automated backups for any instance that
contains necessary data. Backups protect your data from loss or damage.

### Remediation

You can set the autoamted backup option when you create an instance.
Additionally, you can [set this option on an existing
instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/edit-instance#edit_an_instance).
