  Cloud SQL instance should not be in SUSPENDED state
---

**Product**: [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The SUSPENDED state indicates a billing issue with your Google Cloud account.
You can determine your billing status by filing a Billing Support Request.
After the billing issue is resolved, the instance returns to runnable status
within a few hours. Note that suspended MySQL instances are deleted after 90
days.

### Remediation

Make sure that your billing status is not disabled and has no issue by filing a [Billing Support
Request](https://cloud.google.com/support/billing/?visit_id=638223058593313080-26640928&rd=1).
