**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

It's recommended to use VPC-native clusters.
VPC-native clusters use alias IP address ranges on GKE nodes and are required
for private GKE clusters and for creating clusters on Shared VPCs, as well as
many other features.

VPC-native clusters scale more easily than routes-based clusters without consuming
Google Cloud routes and so are less susceptible to hitting routing limits.

### Remediation

Migrate to VPC-Native cluster by recreating the cluster.
