  BigQuery external connection with Cloud SQL does not fail
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

When connecting with Cloud SQL external connection using bigquery the BigQuery
Connection Service Agent is automatically created and given an IAM role as Cloud
SQL client. If the role doesn't exists, query over the associated data source
connection fails.

### Remediation

Ensure that valid credentials were used and all prerequisites were followed to
create the connection for Cloud SQL. Check if the service account that is
automatically created when a connection to Cloud SQL is created has the Cloud
SQL Client (roles/cloudsql.client) role. The service account is of the
following format:
service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-bigqueryconnection.iam.gserviceaccount.com
