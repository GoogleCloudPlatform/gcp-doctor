  A Dataflow job doesn't stuck in the cancelling state
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

A Dataflow job may get stuck in the cancelling state if
it is requested to cancel while a snapshot is in progress.

### Remediation

Consider force canceling in this situation as force canceling is only intended for jobs that have become stuck in the regular canceling process. For more information, see [Force cancel a job](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/stopping-a-pipeline#forcecancel).
