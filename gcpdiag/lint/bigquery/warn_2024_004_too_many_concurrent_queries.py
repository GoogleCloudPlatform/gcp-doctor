"""BigQuery job not exceeding the concurrent queries limit for remote functions.

BigQuery encountered a "Exceeded rate limits" error. This means the number of
queries simultaneously using remote functions surpassed a predefined
threshold to ensure system stability. To avoid overloading the system,
BigQuery restricts the number of concurrent operations.
