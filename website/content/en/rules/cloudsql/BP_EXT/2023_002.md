  Cloud SQL is not configured with Deletion Protection.

**Product**: [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)\
**Rule class**: BP_EXT - (Extended) Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Protect your CloudSQL instance and backups from accidental deletion.

### Remediation

You can set the deletion protection option when you create an instance. Additionally, you can set this option on an existing instance. In both cases, deletion is prevented at the instance level. By default, the deletion protection option is disabled unless you use the Google Cloud console or Terraform to create an instance.
