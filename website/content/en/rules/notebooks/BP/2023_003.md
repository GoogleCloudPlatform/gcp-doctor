**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Maintaining runtimes up to date is generally beneficial thanks to new
capabilities, framework updates, package updates, and bug fixes that have been
implemented in newer versions of your environment.

### Remediation

You can manually upgrade a managed notebooks instance in the Google Cloud
console. Go to the Managed notebooks page and click the `Upgrade all` button if
you want to upgrade all upgradeable instances. Otherwise, select the managed
notebooks instance that you want to upgrade.
