**Product**: [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

When configuring Cloud Functions, you can choose how much memory is allocated to run the function. By default, the memory allocated to each function is 256 MB. You should ensure that the function executes within the amount of memory specified otherwise they will encounter an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error which will interrupt their function invocation.
