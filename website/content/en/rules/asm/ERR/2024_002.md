  Sufficient resources (CPU and memory) then Istiod pods are scheduled.
---

**Product**: [Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/anthos)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

When provisioning ASM, make sure that the istiod ods have sufficient resources
so that they can be scheduled properly.

Insufficient memory or CPU resources can prevent Istiod pods from being
scheduled, potentially leading to control plane malfunctions and disruptions in
Anthos Service Mesh (ASM) functionality.

### Remediation

If the Istiod pods are not getting enough resources, you may need to increase
their resource requests in the Istio configuration. Also, ensure that your GKE nodes
have enough allocatable CPU and memory resources to accommodate the increased
requests for Istiod pods.

### Further information

- Further, checking the Istiod logs will likely give more info.
