**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

User-managed notebooks instances can report the system health of the core
services like Docker service, Docker reverse proxy agent, Jupyter service and
Jupyter API.

### Remediation

To use system health guest attributes to report on your user-managed notebooks
instance's health, you must select the **Enable system health report** checkbox
when you create a user-managed notebooks instance.

You can enable the system health report by using either the Google Cloud
console or the Google Cloud CLI.
