  GKE Workload Identity is enabled
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: SEC - Potential security issue

### Description

Workload Identity allows a Kubernetes service account in your GKE cluster
to act as an IAM service account. Pods that use the configured Kubernetes
service account automatically authenticate as the IAM service account when
accessing [Google Cloud APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis).
Using Workload Identity allows you to assign distinct, fine-grained identities
and authorization for each application in your cluster,
along with protecting the node's metadata (GCE MD).

Without Workload Identity, node's [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview)
is used by the pods/containers that has access to subset of GCP APIs.

### Remediation
[Enable and configure Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity)
on your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.
