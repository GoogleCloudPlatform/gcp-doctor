  Cloud SQL instance is covered by the SLA
---

**Product**: [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)\
**Rule class**: BP_EXT - (Extended) Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Only Cloud SQL instances configured for high availability with at least one
dedicated CPU are covered by the Cloud SQL SLA. Shared-core instances and
single-zone instances are not covered by the SLA. These machine types are
configured to use a shared-core CPU, and are designed to provide low-cost test
and development instances only. Don't use them for production instances.

### Remediation

You can change the machine type and high availability configurations when you
create an instance. Otherwise, you can [set this option on an existing
instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/edit-instance#edit_an_instance).
