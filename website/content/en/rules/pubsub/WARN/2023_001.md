**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

A detached subscription is one whose reading privilege from the topic
has been revoked; it's retained messages are also deleted.
To free up the quota, it should be deleted.

### Remediation

Detached subscriptions can be effectively deleted on console, using the gcloud
command `gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete SUBSCRIPTION_ID` or using REST
APIs - [doc](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/delete-subscriptions).

The deleting user account needs to have the `roles/pubsub.editor` IAM role or a
role with similar permissions.
