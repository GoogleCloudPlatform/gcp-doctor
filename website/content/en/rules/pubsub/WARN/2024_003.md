  Pub/Sub service account has the Encrypter and Decrypter Role if CMEK exist.
---

**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

As long as the service account has the CyptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter role, the
service can encrypt and decrypt its data. If you revoke this role, or if you
disable or destroy the CMEK key, that data can't be accessed.

### Remediation

Assign the [`roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter`](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/encryption#using-cmek)
role to the Pub/Sub Service Account to assign CyptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter role Permissions.
