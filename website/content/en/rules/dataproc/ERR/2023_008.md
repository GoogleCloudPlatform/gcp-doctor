  Disk space of YARN NodeManagers is okay.

**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

YARN ResourceManager has reported UNHEALTHY YARN NodeManagers due to exceeding the maximum percentage of disk space utilization allowed.

### Remediation
- The user cache is stored in the directory specified by the `yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs` property in the `yarn-site.xml` file. This file is located at `/etc/hadoop/conf/yarn-site.xml`. You can check the free space in the `/hadoop/yarn/nm-local-dir` path, and free up space by deleting the `/hadoop/yarn/nm-local-dir/usercache` user cache folder.
- Recreate your cluster with larger disk space, which will increase the [throughput cap](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/support/spark-job-tuning#optimize_disk_size).

### Further information
- Check the following documentation to address the issue:
https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/support/spark-job-tuning#yarn_nodes_are_unhealthy.
- YARN properties: [yarn-default.xml](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/yarn-default.xml).
