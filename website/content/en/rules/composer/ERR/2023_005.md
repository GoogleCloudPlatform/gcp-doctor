  Composer environment deletion not failed due to NAT configuration
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Having Composer automatically create pods and services' secondary IP ranges and
then configuring Cloud NAT for the subnet and these ranges makes it so the
environment deletion will fail. Verify a Composer environment deletion attempt
failed due to a Cloud NAT configuration.

### Remediation

- Identify the relevant NAT Gateway ID(From the error message)
- Find the NAT Gateway `(Network services > Cloud NAT)` and remove the IP ranges that are no longer needed (ranges that are used by the environment's GKE cluster) in NAT mapping.
- Delete the Composer Environment again.
