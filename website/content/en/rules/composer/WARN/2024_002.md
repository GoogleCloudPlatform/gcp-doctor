  Cloud Composer Airflow Worker Pods not in Eviction state.
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Pod eviction can happen when a particular pod in your environment's cluster
reaches its resource limits.If an Airflow worker pod is evicted, all task
instances running on that pod are interrupted, and later marked as failed by
Airflow.

### Remediation

If you observe Airflow Worker Pod eviction in Composer environment, you might want to:

- [Increase the memory available to workers](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#workloads-workers).
- [Reduce worker concurrency](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#override-worker-concurrency). In this way, a single worker handles fewer tasks at once.
- If you change worker concurrency, you might also want to [increase the maximum number of workers](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#worker-count).
