   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/gce1                                               [ OK ]

   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/mig-4h21                                           [FAIL]

     no service account
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/mig-7pvl                                           [FAIL]
     missing scope: logging.write
     no service account

   The service account used by GCE instance should have the logging.logWriter
   permission and a GCE instance should have the logging.write access scope,
   otherwise, if you install the logging agent, it won't be able to send the
   logs to Cloud Logging.
