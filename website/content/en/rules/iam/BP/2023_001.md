  Found enforcement of Policy Constraint AutomaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts in production projects
---

**Product**: [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://cloud.google.com/iam)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Policy Constraint "Automatic Iam Grants For DefaultServiceAccounts" should be set and enforced
in production projects according to security best practices.
https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#automatic-role-grants
According to security best practices, admins should limit as much as possible the permission set
of all users and service accounts of a project. This policy Constraint will prevent the automatic
'editor' role grant to default service accounts (zero trust
approach- https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/what-zero-trust-identity-security)

### Remediation
To improve security, we strongly recommend that you disable the automatic role grant.
Use the iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts boolean constraint to disable
the automatic role grant.
