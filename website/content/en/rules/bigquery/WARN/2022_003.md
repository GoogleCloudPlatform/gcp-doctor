  BigQuery copy job does not exceed the daily copy quota
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

The copy job fails because the number of copy jobs running in a project has
exceeded the daily limit.
You can search in the Logs Explorer with the logging query:
```
resource.type="bigquery_resource"
severity=ERROR
"Quota exceeded: Your project exceeded quota for copies per project."
```

### Remediation

- Retry after the daily quota is refreshed
- If the goal of the frequent copy operations is to create a snapshot of data, consider using
  [table snapshots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/table-snapshots-intro) instead.
  Table snapshots are cheaper and faster alternative to copying full tables.
- You can request a quota increase by contacting support or sales. It might take several days to
  review and process the request. We recommend stating the priority, use case, and the project ID
  in the request.
