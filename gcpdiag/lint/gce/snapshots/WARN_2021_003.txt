   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/gce1                                               [ OK ]
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/gce2                                               [ OK ]
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/mig-4h21                                           [FAIL]
     no service account
   - gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa/mig-7pvl                                           [FAIL]
     no service account

   The service account used by GCE instance should have the
   monitoring.metricWriter permission and a GCE instance should have the
   monitoring.write access scope, otherwise, if you install the ops or
   monitoring agent, it won't be able to send the metrics to Cloud Monitoring.
