  Dataflow job is using supported Apache Beam SDK version
---

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Apache Beam SDK versions are supported by Dataflow from their release date until their deprecation date.

### Remediation

When an SDK version is deprecated, it continues to work with Dataflow but might be decommissioned in the future. Before an SDK version is decommissioned, customers are notified and given time to upgrade their environments. Requests for jobs submitted from deprecated SDK versions result in a warning message. It's recommended that you update environments that use a deprecated version of an SDK to a supported version, but deprecated SDK versions continue to work with Dataflow.
