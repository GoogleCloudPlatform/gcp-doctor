  The Dataflow job has the necessary GCS permissions for the temporary bucket.

**Product**: [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Two primary reasons cause Dataflow jobs to fail when writing to a storage bucket: either the specified bucket does not exist within the targeted Google Cloud project, or the associated service account lacks the necessary permissions to write to it.

### Remediation

- If the bucket is missing, create it in the target project
- If this is permissions error, assign the role ```storage.objectAdmin``` to the service account. The service account is the same which is managing the Compute Engine instance.
