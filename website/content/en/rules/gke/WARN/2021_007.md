  GKE nodes have enough free space on the boot disk.

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description


GKE nodes need free space on their boot disks to be able to function properly.
If /var is getting full, it might be because logs are not being rotated
correctly, or maybe a container is creating too much data in the overlayfs.
