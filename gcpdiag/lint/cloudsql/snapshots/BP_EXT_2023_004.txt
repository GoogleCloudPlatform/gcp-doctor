*  cloudsql/BP_EXT/2023_004: Cloud SQL instance is covered by the SLA
   - https://sqladmin.googleapis.com/v1/projects/gcpdiag-cloudsql1-aaaa/instances/sql1 [FAIL]

   Only Cloud SQL instances configured for high availability with at least one
   dedicated CPU are covered by the Cloud SQL SLA. Shared-core instances and
   single-zone instances are not covered by the SLA. These machine types are
   configured to use a shared-core CPU, and are designed to provide low-cost
   test and development instances only. Don't use them for production instances.
