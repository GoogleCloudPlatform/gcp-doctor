  Cloud Composer does not override the StatsD configuration
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Metrics from Cloud Composer like scheduler heartbeat, number of completed tasks
and pods are collected via the StatsD daemon. If you override the default StatsD
configuration, it will cause missing metrics in the monitoring pages and
components including airflow-scheduler that depend on Statsd metrics for
healthcheck will be marked as unhealthy.

### Remediation

Remove the overridden StatsD Airflow configurations, otherwise the monitoring page
will never work.

Note that there is no way to make both the composer default settings and your
customized StatsD settings work.
