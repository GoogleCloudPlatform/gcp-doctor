  GCE nodes have good disk performance.

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description


Verify that the persistent disks used by the GCE instances provide a "good"
performance, where good is defined to be less than 100ms IO queue time. If it's
more than that, it probably means that the instance would benefit from a faster
disk (changing the type or making it larger).
