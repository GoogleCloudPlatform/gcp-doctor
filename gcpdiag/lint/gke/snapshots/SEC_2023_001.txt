   Workload Identity is the recommended way for your workloads running on Google
   Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to access Google Cloud services in a secure and
   manageable way. It lets you assign distinct, fine-grained identities and
   authorization for each application in your cluster. The sensitive node's
   metadata is also protected by Workload Identity.
