### Description

A private cluster is a type of VPC-native cluster that only depends on internal IP addresses.
Nodes, Pods, and Services in a private cluster require unique subnet IP address ranges.

Private clusters are used when the applicationas and services are needed to be isolated from
the outside connections completely.
This ensures the workloads are private and not exposed to untrusted sources.
