  Dataproc cluster check permissions on shared Host VPC Project
---

**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description
Dataproc cluster launched on a shared VPC requires permission on the Host Subnet
that is used to create the cluster. If the required set of permissions are not
available, the cluster launch operation fails.
The permission is to be set for DataProc service agent from service project.

### Remediation
- You can check the permissions on Host Project where the Shared VPC exists.
The permissions need to be set for DataProc service agent from project where
cluster is launched.

  Permissions Required : Computer Network User, Compute Network Viewer
