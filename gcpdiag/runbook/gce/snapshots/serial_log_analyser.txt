gce/serial-log-analyser:  GCE VM Serial log analyser

    This runbook is designed to assist you in investigating the serial console logs of a vm.

    Key Investigation Areas:

    Boot Issues:
        - Check for Boot issues happening due to Kernel Panics
        - Check for GRUB related issues.
        - Check if system failed to find boot disk.
        - Check if Filesystem corruption is causing issues with system boot.
        - Check if "/" Filesystem consumption is causing issues with system boot.

    Memory crunch issues:
        - Check if OOM kills happened on the VM or any other memory related issues.

    Network related issues:
        - Check if metadata server became unreachable since last boot.
        - Check if there are any time sync related errors.

    SSHD checks:
        - Check if we have logs related to scuccessful startup of SSHD service.

    Google Guest Agent checks:
        - Check if we have logs related to scuccessful startup of Google Guest Agent.
    
[START]: Fetching VM details
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if all logs available since last boot of the instance
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Initiating kernel panic check on the Guest OS.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if Filesystem corruption is causing issues with system boot.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking for high disk utilization related logs in serial console logs
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if there are any memory related errors in Serial logs
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking for network related errors
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking for Time Sync related errors
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Examining SSHD functionality via serial logs.
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking for Guest Agent startup logs
[END]: Finalizing Serial console Log Analysis...
