*  gce/WARN/2021_001: GCE VM Instance Access Scope, GCE VM Attached Service Account Permissions and APIs Required for Logging.
   - projects/gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa                                           [FAIL] Cloud Logging API Not Enabled on project gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa
     Please enable Cloud Logging API on the project with the command: 
     gcloud services enable logging.googleapis.com --project=gcpdiag-gce1-aaaa
     Ops Agent requires the API to collect logs from GCE VMs and display on Logs Explorer

   A GCP project should have Cloud Logging API enabled. The service account
   attached to the GCE VM instances should have the logging.logWriter IAM role
   permission. Also, a GCE instance should have the logging.write access scope.
   Without these, Ops Agent won't be able to collect logs from GCE VMs and
   display on Logs Explorer.
