  Cloud Composer has no more than 2 Airflow schedulers
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: BP_EXT - (Extended) Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Cloud Composer is configured more than 2 Airflow schedulers.

In general, extra schedulers more than 2 consumes resources of your environment
without contributing to overall performance. We recommend starting with two
schedulers and then monitoring the performance of your environment.

### Remediation

Ensure that having more than 2 schedulers doesn't affect the performance
negatively. Otherwise adjust the schedulers less or equal to 2.
