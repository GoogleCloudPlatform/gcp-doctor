  GCE Shielded VM secure boot validations
---

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

  Identifies if Shielded VMs are facing boot issues due to Secure boot
  configurations and if there are Secure boot related fail events in
  cloud logging.

### Remediation

  To determine the cause of boot integrity validation failure, please
  [review the article](https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/integrity-monitoring#diagnosing-failure).

  [Update the baseline](https://cloud.google.com/compute/shielded-vm/docs/integrity-monitoring#updating-baseline)
  after any planned boot-specific changes in the instance configuration,
  like kernel updates or kernel driver installation, as these will cause
  integrity validation failures.

  If you have an unexpected integrity validation failure, you should
  investigate the reason for the failure and be prepared to stop the
  instance if necessary.
