  Cloud Composer tasks are not failed due to resource pressure
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

During execution of a task, Airflow worker's subprocess responsible for Airflow
task execution could be interrupted abruptly due to resource pressure. In this
case, the task would be failed without emitting logs.

### Remediation

Possible solutions:
- In Cloud Composer 1, create a new environment with a larger [machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource) than the current machine type.
Consider adding more nodes to your environment and lower [[celery]worker_concurrency](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#worker-concurrency) for your workers.
- In Cloud Composer 2, [increase memory
  limits](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/scale-environments#autoscaling-workers) for Airflow workers.
