  Cloud Composer Scheduler CPU limit exceeded
---

**Product**: [Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer)
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Airflow scheduler's CPU and memory metrics help you check whether the
scheduler's performance is a bottleneck in the overall Airflow performance.

### Remediation

If Scheduler CPU usage exceeds 80% for longer than a few percent of the total
time, you might want to:

[Increase the DAG file parsing interval](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#override-file-process)
and [increase the DAG directory listing interval](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#override-dir-list)
[Increase the number of schedulers.](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#scheduler-count)
[Increase the CPU of schedulers.](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/optimize-environments#workloads-scheduler)
