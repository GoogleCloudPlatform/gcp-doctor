---

**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

The Compute Engine Virtual Machine instances (VMs) in a Dataproc cluster must be able to communicate with each other using ICMP, TCP (all ports), and UDP (all ports) protocols.

### Remediation
You must create your own rule that meets [Dataproc connectivity requirements](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/network#dataproc_connectivity_requirements) and apply it to your cluster's VPC network.
