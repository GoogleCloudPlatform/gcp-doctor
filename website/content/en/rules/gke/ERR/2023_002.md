**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Private cluster is a type of VPC-native cluster and must not be Routes-based.
VPC-native clusters use alias IP address ranges on GKE nodes and are required
for private GKE clusters and for creating clusters on Shared VPCs, as well as many
other features.

### Remediation

Migrate to VPC-Native private cluster by recreating the cluster.
