gce/serial-log-analyzer:  Google Compute Engine VM Serial log analyzer

    This runbook is designed to assist you in investigating the serial console logs of a vm.

    Key Investigation Areas:

    Boot Issues:
        - Check for Boot issues happening due to Kernel Panics
        - Check for GRUB related issues.
        - Check if system failed to find boot disk.
        - Check if Filesystem corruption is causing issues with system boot.
        - Check if "/" Filesystem consumption is causing issues with system boot.

    Memory crunch issues:
        - Check if OOM kills happened on the VM or any other memory related issues.

    Network related issues:
        - Check if metadata server became unreachable since last boot.
        - Check if there are any time sync related errors.

    SSHD checks:
        - Check if we have logs related to successful startup of SSHD service.

    SSHD Auth Failures checks:
        - Check for SSH issues due to bad permissions of files or directories

    Google Guest Agent checks:
        - Check if we have logs related to successful startup of Google Guest Agent.

    SSH guard check:
        - Check if SSHGuard is active and may be blocking IP addresses
    
[START]: Fetching VM details
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if all logs available since last boot of the instance

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [OK]
     [REASON]
     Found all logs since last boot of the VM.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Initiating kernel panic check on the Guest OS.

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     The logs retrieved does not contain positive or negative entries which
     would help make conclusive assessment. You will need to double check
     This if it's a likely cause.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Manually view the serial logs [0] to assess if there is kernel Panic
     issues

     Address underlying issues leading to bootup issues:
     Consult the troubleshooting guide for kernel panic errors [1]

     Common causes of kernel panic within linux guest os
     File system errors
     Examining `/etc/fstab` for file system errors that could halt the boot process. [2]

     Use gce-rescue available in cloud shell [2] rescue faulty VMs:

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     We did not find any high disk utilisation related errors in Serial console logs

     [REMEDIATION]
     NOTICE: No message available to parse for this step
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if any slow Disk operations related errors in Serial console logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     We did not find any slow Disk operations related errors in Serial console logs

     [REMEDIATION]


[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking if there are any memory related errors in Serial logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     We did not find any Memory related errors in Serial console logs

     [REMEDIATION]
     You may check if VM is facing high memory utilisation from GuestOS side using `free -m`
     or `cat /proc/meminfo` commands.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking for network related errors

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     The metadata server(169.254.169.254) is unreachable from the insatnce.
     The instance might not have IP assigned to its primary NIC.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Please try to login via Serial console using password and check Network stack status.
     If login via Serial console is not possible, You might want to restart the instance.
     If issue persists post reboot as well, you may follow the steps
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-vm to rescue the vm and
     troubleshoot further.

     Additionally, this document shows you how to resolve issues with the Compute Engine metadata server.
     https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-metadata-server

     We did not find any Time sync related errors in Serial console logs.

     [REMEDIATION]
     To verify, please check your system Logs for below patterns:
         'time may be out of sync',
         'System clock is unsynchronized',
         'Time drift detected',
         'no servers can be used, system clock unsynchronized'

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Examining SSHD functionality via serial logs.

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [OK]
     [REASON]
     Detected that SSHD is running within the VM

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Examining SSHD authentication failures via serial logs.

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     We are not able to find the success or failed logs for SSHD authentication issues.

     [REMEDIATION]
     To check if sshd_auth_failures are happening due to wrong directory permissions:
     1. Follow either of the below steps to check the permissions:
       a. these steps to rescue the vm:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/rescue-vm

       b. these steps login through serial console:
          https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-using-serial-console

     2. Check the system logs for following error messages:
        'Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory'
        'Error updating SSH keys for user1: mkdir /home/USER/.ssh: no such file or directory'

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking for Guest Agent startup logs

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [OK]
     [REASON]
     Detected that Google Guest Agent is running within the VM

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Analyzing SSHGuard intrusion detection functionality on the VM (if any)

   - gcpdiag-gce-vm-performance/faulty-linux-ssh                          [UNCERTAIN]
     [REASON]
     The logs retrieved does not contain positive or negative entries which
     would help make conclusive assessment. You will need to double check
     This if it's a likely cause.

     [REMEDIATION]
     If SSHGuard or similar application is a concern,
     manually inspect its configuration via the interactive serial console:
