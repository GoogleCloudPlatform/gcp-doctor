  Pub/Sub Service Account has the Publisher and Subscriber Permissions if DLQ Subscription(s) exist.

**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

To forward undeliverable messages to a dead-letter topic, Pub/Sub must have the
'roles/pubsub.subscriber' and 'roles/pubsub.publisher' permissions enabled on the
automatically created Pub/Sub service account.

### Remediation

In Pub/Sub, access control can be configured at the project level and at the individual resource level.
Pub/Sub creates and maintains a service account for each project: `service-{project-number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
You can grant forwarding permissions by assigning publisher and subscriber roles to this service account.

- Project Level: [Access control with IAM](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/access-control#console)

- Individual resource level: [Grant IAM roles to use dead-letter topics](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/handling-failures#grant_forwarding_permissions) to the service account.
