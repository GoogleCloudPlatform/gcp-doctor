  Global Access enabled on Regional Internal Load Balancer
---

**Product**: [Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

When global access is not on, resources/clients in other location might not be able to visit the Internal Load Balancer(iLB).
It's recommended to enable the global access in regional iLB.

### Remediation

By default global access is not enabled in regional iLB. You have to [enable global access](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/l7-internal/setting-up-l7-internal#global-access) to allow clients from any region to access your load balancer. Backends must also be in the same region as the load balancer.
