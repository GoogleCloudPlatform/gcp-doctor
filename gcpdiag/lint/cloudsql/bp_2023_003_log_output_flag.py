"""Cloud SQL instance's log_output flag is not configured as TABLE

If you set log_output to TABLE, the log output is placed in a table in the mysql
system database. It might consume a considerable amount of disk space. If this
table becomes large, it can affect instance restart time or cause the instance
to lose its SLA coverage. For this reason, the TABLE option is not recommended.
