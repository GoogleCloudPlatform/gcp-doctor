gke/ip-exhaustion: Troubleshooting ip exhaustion issues on GKE clusters.

  This runbook investigates the gke cluster for ip exhaustion issues and recommends remediation
  steps.

  Areas Examined:
  - GKE cluster type.
  - GKE cluster and nodepool configuration
  - Stackdriver logs
    
[START]: Starting the IP Exhaustion diagnostics

   - gcpdiag-gke3-gggg                                                    [OK]
     [REASON]
     Cluster cluster-1 found in us-central1-c for project gcpdiag-gke3-gggg
[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking node IP Exhaustion and offering remediation steps
[INFO]: Searching cloud logging for the string IP_SPACE_EXHAUSTED which indicates IP Exhaustion issue
[INFO]: IP_SPACE_EXHAUSTED error found for cluster cluster-1 and subnet public-subnet

   - gcpdiag-gke3-gggg/us-central1-c/cluster-1                            [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Node IP exhaustion is detected in the cluster cluster-1 for the subnet public-subnet


     [REMEDIATION]
     Please follow the below documentation [1] to expand the ip range of the node subnet.
     The subnet that has exhausted its IP space is public-subnet.

[AUTOMATED STEP]: Checking Pod IP Exhaustion and offering remediation steps
[INFO]: Verifying if the cluster is an Autopilot cluster or a Standard cluster.
[INFO]: Cluster is a Standard cluster

   - gcpdiag-gke3-gggg/us-central1-c/cluster-1                            [FAIL]
     [REASON]
     Pod IP exhaustion is detected in the cluster cluster-1

     [REMEDIATION]
     Consider leveraging the Class E IPv4 address space (240.0.0.0/4) to support your growth.
     While these addresses are reserved for future use (see Google VPC network valid IPv4 ranges [1]), they can be used in certain situations.

     The linked documentation [2] addresses common misconceptions about Class E, discusses its benefits and considerations, and provides guidance on planning and using GKE clusters with this address space.
     It also includes a real-world example of how Class E successfully solved IP exhaustion challenges.

     Additionally, the documentation [3] provides instructions to add ipv4 pod range to a standard cluster to mitgate the issue.
