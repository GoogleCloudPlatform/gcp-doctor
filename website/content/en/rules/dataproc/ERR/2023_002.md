  Checking if any orphaned YARN application has been killed by dataproc agent in the cluster.
---

**Product**: [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description
Dataproc considers a yarn app to be orphaned if the job driver that submitted the
yarn app has exited.
By default, dataproc:dataproc.yarn.orphaned-app-termination.enable is set to True,
which means Dataproc agent is enabled to kill the orphaned yarn app.

### Remediation
- You can see the log from dataproc agent if the yarn app became orphaned and
killed by dataproc agent.

  Log query example :

  resource.type="cloud_dataproc_cluster" \
  resource.labels.cluster_uuid="<Datproc_cluster_uuid>" \
  "<YARN_app_id>" \
  logName: "projects/<project-name>/logs/google.dataproc.agent"

- If you use Spark cluster mode (spark.submit.deployMode=cluster) with
spark.yarn.submit.waitAppCompletion=false, then you should also set
dataproc:dataproc.yarn.orphaned-app-termination.enable=false
