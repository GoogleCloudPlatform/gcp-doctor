gke/ip-exhaustion: Troubleshooting ip exhaustion issues on GKE clusters.

  This runbook investigates the gke cluster for ip exhaustion issues and recommends remediation
  steps.

  Areas Examined:

  - GKE cluster type.

  - GKE cluster and nodepool configuration

  - Stackdriver logs

[GATEWAY]: Checking IP Exhaustion and cluster configuration
[INFO]: Searching cloud logging for the string "IP_SPACE_EXHAUSTED" AND "cluster-1" which indicates IP Exhaustion issue

   - gcpdiag-gke3-gggg/us-central1-c/cluster-1                            [FAIL]
     [REASON]
       Node IP exhaustion is detected in the cluster cluster-1:

       Requested resource is exhausted: Not all instances running in IGM after 50.049254938s. Expected 4, running 3, transitioning 1. Current errors: [IP_SPACE_EXHAUSTED]: Instance 'gke-cluster-1-default-pool-a6ea5e55-h1ms' creation failed: IP space of 'projects/gcpdiag-gke3-gggg/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/public-subnet' is exhausted. .
