  Cloud SQL instance's memory usage does not exceed 90%
---

**Product**: [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

If you have less than 10% memory in database/memory/components.cache and
database/memory/components.free combined, the risk of an OOM event is high.

### Remediation

[Calculate the maximum memory usage](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/optimize-high-memory-usage#calculate_memory_consumption)
by your MySQL database to select the appropriate instance type for your MySQL
database. After you analyze the memory usage by different components, set the
appropriate flag in your MySQL database. Lastly, if the memory usage is still
high and you feel running queries and flag values are optimized, then consider
[increasing the instance size](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/edit-instance)
to avoid OOM.
