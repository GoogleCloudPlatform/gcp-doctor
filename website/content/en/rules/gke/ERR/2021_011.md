  ip-masq-agent not reporting errors

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description


If ip-masq-agent is reporting errors, it is possible that the config received
is invalid. In that case, it is possible that the applied config is not
reflecting the desired masquerading behavior, which could lead to unexpected
connectivity issues.

For more details on how to configure ip-masq-agent, please review:
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent#config_agent_configmap

To find these logs, you can use this filter:

resource.type="k8s_container" AND resource.labels.container_name="ip-masq-agent"
AND log_id("stderr")
