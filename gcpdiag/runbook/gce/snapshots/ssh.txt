gce/ssh: Provides a comprehensive analysis of common issues which affects SSH connectivity to VMs.

  This runbook focuses on a range of potential problems for both Windows and Linux VMs on
  Google Cloud Platform. By conducting a series of checks, the runbook aims to pinpoint the
  root cause of SSH access difficulties.

  The following areas are examined:

  - VM Instance Status: Evaluates the VM's current state, performance - ensuring that it is running
    and not impaired by high CPU usage, insufficient memory, or disk space issues that might disrupt
    normal SSH operations.

  - User Permissions: Checks for the necessary Google Cloud IAM permissions that are required to
    leverage OS Login features and to use metadata-based SSH keys for authentication.

  - VM Configuration: Analyzes the VM's metadata settings to confirm the inclusion of SSH keys,
    flags and other essential configuration details that facilitate SSH access.

  - GCE Network Connectivity Tests: Reviews applicable firewall rules to verify that there are no
    network barriers preventing SSH access to the VM.

  - Internal Guest OS Checks: Analysis available Guest OS metrics or logs to detect any
    misconfigurations or service disruptions that could be obstructing SSH functionality.

     Memory utilization on this VM has reached levels that may compromise its VM application performance.

     [REMEDIATION]
     Elevated memory usage can result in slow or unresponsive or termimated applications.
     Consider enhancing the VM's memory capacity by changing to a machine type with more memory.
