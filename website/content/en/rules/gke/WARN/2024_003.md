 Ingress creation is successful if service is correctly mapped
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

If the service associated with an existing Ingress is inadvertently deleted,
the Ingress is left in a "dangling" or orphaned state. This occurs because the
Ingress relies on the presence of the mapped service to route incoming traffic
effectively. Consequently, the Ingress becomes unable to fulfill its primary
function of directing requests to the intended service.

Error Seen in Cloud logging/UI: "Translation failed: invalid ingress spec:\
could not find service"

### Remediation

To fix a dangling or ineffective Ingress in GKE,  recreate the missing service,
update the Ingress to point to the correct service.
