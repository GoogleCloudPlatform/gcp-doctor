  Session Affinity configured on backend services for Global External Application load balancers
---

**Product**: [Backend services](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

In some cases, it might be beneficial for the same backend to handle requests that are from the same end users,
or related to the same end user, at least for a short period of time.
This can be configured by using session affinity, a setting configured on the backend service.

### Remediation

Depending on your application, you can use different backend services with different session affinity settings.
For example, if a part of your application is serving static content to many users, it is unlikely to benefit from session affinity.You would use a Cloud CDN-enabled backend service to serve cached responses instead.
