  BigQuery CMEK-related operations do not fail due to missing permissions
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

BigQuery CMEK-related operations will fail if the BigQuery encryption service account for that project does not have the permission to encrypt and decrypt using
that CMEK KMS key.

You can search in the Logs Explorer for such failing operations with the logging query:
```
resource.type="bigquery_resource"
severity=ERROR
protoPayload.serviceName="bigquery.googleapis.com"
protoPayload.status.message=~"Access Denied: BigQuery BigQuery: Cloud KMS Error: Permission .* Please grant Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter role to BigQuery service account.*"
```

### Remediation

To protect your BigQuery data with a CMEK key, grant the BigQuery
encryption service account permission to encrypt and decrypt using
that key via the Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter IAM role. The BigQuery encryption service account is of the form `bq-PROJECT_NUMBER@bigquery-encryption.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
