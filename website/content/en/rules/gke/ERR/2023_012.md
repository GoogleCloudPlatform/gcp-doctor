  Missing request for memory resources.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description
Error means that HPA is unable to calculate the number of replicas that should
be scaled up or down based on the current metrics because there is no request for
memory resources specified in the deployment or pod. The HPA requires at least one
metric to be specified to scale the deployment or replica set.

You can use the following filter to find matching log lines:
```
jsonPayload.message="missing request for memory"
resource.type="k8s_cluster"
severity="WARNING"
```
### Remediation
To add a memory resource request to your deployment configuration, simply include a
resources section in your deployment configuration file. You may follow the
steps in the below guide:

### Further information
