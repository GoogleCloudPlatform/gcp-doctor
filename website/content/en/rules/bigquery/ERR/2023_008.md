**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

To verify that the user trying to create or modify scheduled queries has the role
roles/bigquery.admin. If pub sub notification is configured, then user should
also have permission pubsub.topics.getIamPolicy which is part of the role
roles/pubsub.admin.

### Remediation

If the user trying to create or modify scheduled queries doesn't have the role roles/bigquery.admin, then please add it by following [Grant an IAM role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console#grant_an_iam_role)

If pub sub notification is also configured and user doesn't have permission pubsub.topics.getIamPolicy, then please add the permission using a [custom role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating) or add role roles/pubsub.admin which contains this permission.
