*  gcb/ERR/2022_002: Builds didn't fail because of failed registry permissions.
   - gcpdiag-gcb1-aaaa/db540598-5a45-46f3-a716-39d834e884c6               [FAIL]
     gcb-custom1@gcpdiag-gcb1-aaaa.iam.gserviceaccount.com can not read gcb1-repository registry in us-central1 in gcpdiag-gcb1-aaaa project.

   One of your recent builds have failed. It was configured to upload image to
   Artifact Registry, but used service account does not have write permission
   for it. You can resolve this error by granting IAM role to the used service
   account. If you did not specify service account for this build, then it used
   default one: [PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com.
