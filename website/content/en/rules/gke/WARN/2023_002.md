  GKE workload timeout to Compute Engine metadata server.
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

If the workload uses a Google Authentication library, the default timeout
for requests to the Compute Engine Metadata server might be too aggressive.

Failed requests may return something like 'DefaultCredentialsError'.

### Remediation

Check if you are possibly using a Google Authentication library and the requests to the
metadata server are timing out. If so, try increasing the default timeout.

### Further information

For google-auth-library-python, it's possible to set the environment variable GCE_METADATA_TIMEOUT
to increase the [default timeout](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/blob/3fcd31984a019e183debcb6a234821dae0b2af27/google/auth/compute_engine/_metadata.py#L58) of 3 seconds.
