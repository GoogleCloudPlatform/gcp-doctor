  Cloud SQL enables automatic storage increases feature
---

**Product**: [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)\
**Rule class**: BP_EXT - (Extended) Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Configure storage to accomodate critical database maintennance by enabling the
automatic storage increases feature. Otherwise, ensure that you have at least
20% available space to accommodate any critical database maintenance operations
that Cloud SQL may perform. Keep in mind that when an instance becomes unable to
add storage that it needs, the instance likely stops accepting incoming
connections and could go offline.

### Remediation

You can set the automatic storage increases option when you create an instance.
Additionally, you can [set this option on an existing
instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/edit-instance#edit_an_instance).
