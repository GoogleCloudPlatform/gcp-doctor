  Creating Pub/Sub Push didn't fail because of organization policy.
---

**Product**: [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Creating New Pub/Sub Push Subscription in VPC-SC enabled project is not allowed.

Unable to create new Push Subscription if the project is VPC-SC enabled. The
following filter can be used to find the log lines that are matched by the rule:

```
resource.type='pubsub_subscription'
log_name="cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity"
severity=ERROR
protoPayload.methodName="google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber.CreateSubscription"
protoPayload.status.message="Request is prohibited by organization's policy"
```

### Remediation

The workaround is to remove VPC-SC temporarily and create the new Push subscription
and then reapply VPC-SC again.
