  BigQuery query job does not time out during execution
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

A BigQuery query or multi-statement query job  can execute for up to six hours, after which it times out and fails.

You can search in the Logs Explorer for such jobs with the logging query:
```
resource.type="bigquery_resource"
severity=ERROR
protoPayload.methodName="jobservice.jobcompleted"
protoPayload.status.message:"Operation timed out after 6.0 hours"
```

### Remediation

- If the exact query is being run for the first time or has never succeeded before, optimize the query being run by following [documented best practices for BigQuery jobs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-performance-compute).
- If the same query used to succeed before, make sure that there were enough [computational resources (slots)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots) available for the job to run and check whether the amount of data being queried has changed significantly since the last successful run. You can reach out to [Support](https://cloud.google.com/support) if you are not able to determine why the job fails.
