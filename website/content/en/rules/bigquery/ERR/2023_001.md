  There was an API call via the getQueryResults method that returned "Not Found Job: {job ID}"
---

**Product**: [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

This happens when BigQuery jobs have been requested via the API but cannot be found. This can be due to incorrect information being provided in the call, such as the jobID or location. For example, if the jobID is misspelled or the location is not specified (especially if it is not a US or a EU multi-regional location), the job will not be found.


To avoid this error, make sure to provide accurate information in the API call. You can also check the BigQuery job history to see if the job has been completed or deleted.


### Remediation
To ensure that your API calls are correct, verify that they include the necessary information, such as a job ID, project ID, and location (if applicable).

You must specify the location to run the job in the following cases:
  - If the location to run a job is not in the US or the EU multi-regional location.
  - If the job's location is in a single region (for example, us-central1).
