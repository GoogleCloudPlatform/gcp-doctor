  Stateful workloads not run on preemptible node
---

**Product**: [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)\
**Rule class**: BP - Best practice, opinionated recommendation

### Description

Please understand the risk of application level disruption or data corruption if you decide to run stateful workloads on preemptible nodes. You can use node taints and tolerations to make stateful Pods not be scheduled onto node pools that use preemptible VMs.

### Further information

See [public troubleshooting docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/spot-vms#best-practices)
about the best practices using preemptible nodes in GKE.
